If the bidder wants to avail themselves of the Purchase preference, the bidder must be the manufacturer / OEM of the offered product on GeM. Traders are excluded from the purview of Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises and hence resellers offering products manufactured by some other OEM are not eligible for any purchase preference. In respect of bid for Services, the bidder must be the Service provider of the offered Service. Relevant documentary evidence in this regard shall be uploaded along with the bid in respect of the offered product or service and Buyer will decide eligibility for purchase preference based on documentary evidence submitted, while evaluating the bid. If L-1 is not an MSE and MSE Seller (s) has / have quoted price within L-1+ 15% (Selected by Buyer) of margin of purchase preference /price band defined in relevant policy, such MSE Seller shall be given opportunity to match L-1 price and contract will be awarded for 25% (selected by Buyer) percentage of total quantity. The buyers are advised to refer the OM No. F.1/4/2021-PPD dated 18.05.2023 OM_No.1_4_2021_PPD_dated_18.05.2023 for compliance of Concurrent application of Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises Order, 2012 and Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, 2017. Benefits of MSE will be allowed only if seller is validated on-line in GeM profile as well as validated and approved by Buyer after evaluation of documents submitted. 10. Estimated Bid Value indicated above is being declared solely for the purpose of guidance on EMD amount and for determining the Eligibility Criteria related to Turn Over, Past Performance and Project / Past Experience etc. This has no relevance or bearing on the price to be quoted by the bidders and is also not going to have any impact on bid participation. Also this is not going to be used as a criteria in determining reasonableness of quoted prices which would be determined by the buyer based on its own assessment of reasonableness and based on competitive prices received in Bid / RA process. 4 / 7"
