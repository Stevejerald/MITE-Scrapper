In case of bunch bids, the category related to primary product having highest bid value should meet this criterion. 11. Reverse Auction would be conducted amongst first 50% of the technically qualified bidders arranged in the order of prices from lowest to highest. Number of sellers eligible for participating in RA would be rounded off to next higher integer value if number of technically qualified bidders is odd (e.g. if 7 bids are technically qualified, then RA will be conducted amongst L-1 to L-4). In case number of technically qualified bidders are 2 or 3, RA will be between all without any elimination. If Buyer has chosen to split the bid amongst N sellers, then minimum N sellers would be taken to RA round. In case Primary products of only one OEM are left in contention for participation in RA based on lowest 50% bidders qualifying for RA, the number of sellers qualifying for RA would be increased to get at least products of one more OEM (directly participated or through its reseller) if available. Further, if bid(s) of any seller(s) eligible for MSE preference is / are coming within price band of 15% of Non MSE L-1 or if bid of any seller(s) eligible for Make in India preference is / are coming within price band of 20% of non MII L-1, then such MSE / Make in India seller shall also be allowed to participate in the RA process.
