Copies of relevant contracts (proving supply of cumulative order quantity in any one financial year) to be submitted along with bid in support of quantity supplied in the relevant Financial year. In case of bunch bids, the category related to primary product having highest bid value should meet this criterion. 11. Reverse Auction would be conducted amongst all the technically qualified bidders except the Highest quoting bidder. The technically qualified Highest Quoting bidder will not be allowed to participate in RA. However, H-1 will also be allowed to participate in RA in following cases: i. If number of technically qualified bidders are only 2 or 3. ii. If Buyer has chosen to split the bid amongst N sellers, and H1 bid is coming within N. iii. In case Primary product of only one OEM is left in contention for participation in RA on elimination of H-1. iv. If L-1 is non-MSE and H-1 is eligible MSE and H-1 price is coming within price band of 15% of Non-MSE L-1 v. If L-1 is non-MII and H-1 is eligible MII and H-1 price is coming within price band of 20% of Non-MII L-1 LED Display System ( 1 pieces ) 4 / 9"
