If the bidder wants to avail themselves of the Purchase preference, the bidder must be the manufacturer / OEM of the offered product on GeM. Traders are excluded from the purview of Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises and hence resellers offering products manufactured by some other OEM are not eligible for any purchase preference. In respect of bid for Services, the bidder must be the Service provider of the offered Service. Relevant documentary evidence in this regard shall be uploaded along with the bid in respect of the offered product or service and Buyer will decide eligibility for purchase preference based on documentary evidence submitted, while evaluating the bid. If L-1 is not an MSE and MSE Seller (s) has / have quoted price within L-1+ 15% (Selected by Buyer) of margin of purchase preference /price band defined in relevant policy, such MSE Seller shall be given opportunity to match L-1 price and contract will be awarded for 25% (selected by Buyer) percentage of total quantity.

Also this is not going to be used as a criteria in determining reasonableness of quoted prices which would be determined by the buyer based on its own assessment of reasonableness and based on competitive prices received in Bid / RA process. 3. Reverse Auction would be conducted amongst first 50% of the technically qualified bidders arranged in the order of prices from lowest to highest. Number of sellers eligible for participating in RA would be rounded off to next higher integer value if number of technically qualified bidders is odd (e.g. if 7 bids are technically qualified, then RA will be conducted amongst L-1 to L-4). In case number of technically qualified bidders are 2 or 3, RA will be between all without any elimination. If Buyer has chosen to split the bid amongst N sellers, then minimum N sellers would be taken to RA round. In case Primary products of only one OEM are left in contention for participation in RA based on lowest 50% bidders qualifying for RA, the number of sellers qualifying for RA would be increased to get at least products of one more OEM (directly participated or through its reseller) if available.

If the bidder wants to avail themselves of the Purchase preference, the bidder must be the manufacturer / OEM of the offered product on GeM. Traders are excluded from the purview of Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises and hence resellers offering products manufactured by some other OEM are not eligible for any purchase preference. In respect of bid for Services, the bidder must be the Service provider of the offered Service. Relevant documentary evidence in this regard shall be uploaded along with the bid in respect of the offered product or service and Buyer will decide eligibility for purchase preference based on documentary evidence submitted, while evaluating the bid.

Benefits of MSE will be allowed only if seller is validated on-line in GeM profile as well as validated and approved by Buyer after evaluation of documents submitted. 2. Estimated Bid Value indicated above is being declared solely for the purpose of guidance on EMD amount and for determining the Eligibility Criteria related to Turn Over, Past Performance and Project / Past Experience etc. This has no relevance or bearing on the price to be quoted by the bidders and is also not going to have any impact on bid participation. Also this is not going to be used as a criteria in determining reasonableness of quoted prices which would be determined by the buyer based on its own assessment of reasonableness and based on competitive prices received in Bid / RA process. 3. Reverse Auction would be conducted amongst first 50% of the technically qualified bidders arranged in the order of prices from lowest to highest. Number of sellers eligible for participating in RA would be rounded off to next higher integer value if number of technically qualified bidders is odd (e.g. if 7 bids are technically qualified, then RA will be conducted amongst L-1 to L-4). In case number of technically qualified bidders are 2 or 3, RA will be between all without any elimination. If Buyer has chosen to split the bid amongst N sellers, then minimum N sellers would be taken to RA round. In case Primary products of only one OEM are left in contention for participation in RA based on lowest 50% bidders qualifying for RA, the number of sellers qualifying for RA would be increased to get at least products of one more OEM (directly participated or through its reseller) if available. Further, if bid(s) of any seller(s) eligible for MSE preference is / are coming within price band of 15% of Non MSE L-1 or if bid of any seller(s) eligible for Make in India preference is / are coming within price band of 20% of non MII L-1, then such MSE / Make in India seller shall also be allowed to participate in the RA process.
