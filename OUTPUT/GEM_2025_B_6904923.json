This category covers two classes of products — OEM Cartridges/Consumables and Compatible Cartridges/Consumables — to enable buyers to procure both original and compatible options in a transparent and competitive manner. 2. Definitions: (a) OEM Cartridge/Consumable refers to a cartridge manufactured by a company that also manufactures printing machines such as printers, multifunction (all-in-one) devices, or plotter printers, and is intended for use with those machines. (b) Compatible Cartridge/Consumable refers to a cartridge manufactured by an entity other than the OEM of the printing machine but designed to be compatible with, and functionally replace, the OEM cartridge. 3. The parameter “Product Class of Cartridge” has two values — OEM and Compatible. ‘OEM’ denotes a cartridge having a brand same as that of the printer, while ‘Compatible’ denotes a cartridge having a brand different from the printer(s) but compatible with the printer(s). Buyers can select only ‘OEM’ or only ‘Compatible’ or both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ (or ‘any value’) as per their requirement. 4. Printer OEMs authorised in this category and granted dashboard access shall upload catalogues under Product Class of Cartridge – OEM. Compatible OEMs shall upload catalogues under Product Class of Cartridge – Compatible strictly in accordance with their approved Vendor Assessment (VA) report. 5. Incorrect selection of product class or deviation from the approved VA report by the sellers may attract administrative action, including removal of catalogues, temporary suspension, or any other action deemed appropriate by GeM. 6. The parameter “Model Number of OEM Printer/MFP” shall indicate the printer or multifunction model for which the offered cartridge/consumable is suitable. Sellers shall ensure correct mapping of cartridges/consumables to printer models while creating catalogues. 7. Printer OEMs and Compatible OEMs shall have their respective model/part numbers included in the drop-down options prior to catalogue creation. Catalogues created using unapproved or incorrect model numbers may be removed and attract administrative action. 8. Compatible OEMs shall ensure that their model or part numbers do not resemble those of printer OEMs in any manner likely to mislead or confuse buyers. 9. Sellers requiring inclusion of new model/part numbers (against parameter “Model Number of OEM's Printer Cartridge/Consumable ”) or the OEM’s name (against the parameter “Name of the OEM/Compatible Manufacturer of Cartridge/Consumable Offered”) in drop-down options shall submit such requests to the GeM Helpdesk along with supporting documentation. Requests shall be processed by GeM based on verification of the vendor’s eligibility and the applicable VA report. 10. The parameter “Name of the OEM/Compatible Manufacturer of Cartridge/Consumable Offered” shall indicate the name of either the printer OEM or the compatible OEM, as applicable. Sellers shall select their name only from the approved drop-down options available after completion of Vendor Assessment and inclusion through the Helpdesk process. 11. Buyers should select only one brand/make under the parameter: “Printer:: Multifunction Machines Brand for which offered Cartridge:: Consumable is Suitable.” 12. Buyers procuring only ‘OEM’ cartridges for multiple printer brands through bunched bids shall opt for item-wise evaluation and not total value-wise evaluation, so as to enable participation by resellers of individual brands. Bunching of only ‘OEM’ Cartridges and only ‘Compatible’ Cartridges can be resorted to only when evaluation is item-wise. In case the buyer selects both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’ or alternatively chooses ‘any value’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’, then the bid evaluation method of either ‘Total Value-wise’ or ‘Item- wise’ can be opted for by the buyer as per his/her requirement and desired level of competition based on the availability of sellers. 13. By selecting “As per IS/ISO/IEC 19752:2017”, the seller confirms compliance with equivalent or relevant ISO standards such as ISO/IEC 24711 or ISO/IEC 29102, as applicable to the technology or type of cartridge (Inkjet, Laser, Toner, or Ink). 14. Buyers procuring cartridges through bidding and selecting Product Class – only ‘OEM’ should follow the PAC procurement method after following the prescribed due process, and the PAC certificate duly signed by the competent authority shall be uploaded at the time of bid creation. GeM, however, does not prescribe PAC procurement on its own, and the decision to follow the PAC mode of procurement is the buyer’s call. In case the buyer selects both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’ or alternatively chooses ‘any value’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’, then such PAC may not be required in the bid. 15. The L-1 comparison buying method for Product Class – only ‘OEM’ is not permissible. In case the buyer selects both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’ or alternatively 6 / 9",

This category covers two classes of products — OEM Cartridges/Consumables and Compatible Cartridges/Consumables — to enable buyers to procure both original and compatible options in a transparent and competitive manner. 2. Definitions: (a) OEM Cartridge/Consumable refers to a cartridge manufactured by a company that also manufactures printing machines such as printers, multifunction (all-in-one) devices, or plotter printers, and is intended for use with those machines. (b) Compatible Cartridge/Consumable refers to a cartridge manufactured by an entity other than the OEM of the printing machine but designed to be compatible with, and functionally replace, the OEM cartridge. 3. The parameter “Product Class of Cartridge” has two values — OEM and Compatible. ‘OEM’ denotes a cartridge having a brand same as that of the printer, while ‘Compatible’ denotes a cartridge having a brand different from the printer(s) but compatible with the printer(s). Buyers can select only ‘OEM’ or only ‘Compatible’ or both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ (or ‘any value’) as per their requirement. 4. Printer OEMs authorised in this category and granted dashboard access shall upload catalogues under Product Class of Cartridge – OEM. Compatible OEMs shall upload catalogues under Product Class of Cartridge – Compatible strictly in accordance with their approved Vendor Assessment (VA) report. 5. Incorrect selection of product class or deviation from the approved VA report by the sellers may attract administrative action, including removal of catalogues, temporary suspension, or any other action deemed appropriate by GeM. 6. The parameter “Model Number of OEM Printer/MFP” shall indicate the printer or multifunction model for which the offered cartridge/consumable is suitable. Sellers shall ensure correct mapping of cartridges/consumables to printer models while creating catalogues. 7. Printer OEMs and Compatible OEMs shall have their respective model/part numbers included in the drop-down options prior to catalogue creation. Catalogues created using unapproved or incorrect model numbers may be removed and attract administrative action. 8. Compatible OEMs shall ensure that their model or part numbers do not resemble those of printer OEMs in any manner likely to mislead or confuse buyers. 9. Sellers requiring inclusion of new model/part numbers (against parameter “Model Number of OEM's Printer Cartridge/Consumable ”) or the OEM’s name (against the parameter “Name of the OEM/Compatible Manufacturer of Cartridge/Consumable Offered”) in drop-down options shall submit such requests to the GeM Helpdesk along with supporting documentation. Requests shall be processed by GeM based on verification of the vendor’s eligibility and the applicable VA report. 10. The parameter “Name of the OEM/Compatible Manufacturer of Cartridge/Consumable Offered” shall indicate the name of either the printer OEM or the compatible OEM, as applicable. Sellers shall select their name only from the approved drop-down options available after completion of Vendor Assessment and inclusion through the Helpdesk process. 11. Buyers should select only one brand/make under the parameter: “Printer:: Multifunction Machines Brand for which offered Cartridge:: Consumable is Suitable.” 12. Buyers procuring only ‘OEM’ cartridges for multiple printer brands through bunched bids shall opt for item-wise evaluation and not total value-wise evaluation, so as to enable participation by resellers of individual brands. Bunching of only ‘OEM’ Cartridges and only ‘Compatible’ Cartridges can be resorted to only when evaluation is item-wise. In case the buyer selects both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’ or alternatively chooses ‘any value’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’, then the bid evaluation method of either ‘Total Value-wise’ or ‘Item- wise’ can be opted for by the buyer as per his/her requirement and desired level of competition based on the availability of sellers. 13. By selecting “As per IS/ISO/IEC 19752:2017”, the seller confirms compliance with equivalent or relevant ISO standards such as ISO/IEC 24711 or ISO/IEC 29102, as applicable to the technology or type of cartridge (Inkjet, Laser, Toner, or Ink). 14. Buyers procuring cartridges through bidding and selecting Product Class – only ‘OEM’ should follow the PAC procurement method after following the prescribed due process, and the PAC certificate duly signed by the competent authority shall be uploaded at the time of bid creation. GeM, however, does not prescribe PAC procurement on its own, and the decision to follow the PAC mode of procurement is the buyer’s call. In case the buyer selects both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’ or alternatively chooses ‘any value’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’, then such PAC may not be required in the bid. 15. The L-1 comparison buying method for Product Class – only ‘OEM’ is not permissible. In case the buyer selects both ‘OEM’ and ‘Compatible’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’ or alternatively 6 / 9\n\nchooses ‘any value’ against ‘Product Class of Cartridge’, then the L-1 comparison buying method shall be available subject to other standard prerequisites. The L-1 comparison buying method for Product Class – only ‘Compatible’ is possible subject to other standard prerequisites. 16. For procurement through bidding involving a specific brand of Compatible Cartridges, PAC procurement may be undertaken only after following the prescribed due process. GeM, however, does not prescribe PAC procurement on its own, and the decision to follow the PAC mode of procurement is the buyer’s call. 17. Single Tender procurement without PAC is permissible only where the buying organisation permits such procurement under specific circumstances and where GeM has enabled the Single Tender functionality for that organisation. GeM, however, does not prescribe the Single Tender mode of procurement on its own, and the decision to follow the Single Tender mode of procurement is the buyer’s call. 18. By procuring items under this category, buyers confirm that they have understood the above clauses and agree to them. Any query with regard to the above clauses should be made prior to the procurement or floating of the bid. GeM shall not entertain any bid- or contract-specific query. 19.
